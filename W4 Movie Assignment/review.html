            <h2><em>The Town</em> - Review</h2>

        <p><strong>David Malek</strong></p>
        <p><em>08/25/2021</em></p>
        <p>In this brilliant film, <em>The Town</em>, I found there to be an incredible amount of excitement, a flavorful amount of drama, and a exhilerating amount of action. My absolute favorite part about this movie is the character developement and the acting itself. I think Ben Affleck really keyed into is role in this film and it is easily one of his best performances that I have ever seen. He incapsulates the bank robber vibe, while also delivering a 10/10 love story in the mix. I also really enjoyed Jeremy Renner in this film. He masters the "bad guy" vibes and packs a powerful punch whenever his number is called. Blake Lively also plays a powerful performance on a struggling drugaddict who is a hopeless romantic for Doug MacRay and Dougs counterpart, Rebecca Hall does not disappoint either in her role as the clueless girlfriend to Doug. All in all, this film delivers, in EVER WAY. A MUST SEE FILM! 9.5/10 from me! </p>

            <h3>TRIVIA</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Jeremy Renner surrounded himself with actual convicted bank robbers in Charlestown for research, and to help him nail the accent.</li>
                <li>Before the movie was released, Ben Affleck praised Jeremy Renner's performance. He even jokingly stated that if ever there was a bad shot or performance from someone else in a scene, editing could easily cut to Renner looking at a napkin in order to make the scene work. Jeremy Renner later would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance.</li>
                <li>Ben Affleck was struggling to find the right actor for the role of James Couglin. His younger brother Casey Affleck suggested Jeremy Renner, who he'd worked with in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007).</li>
